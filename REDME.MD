🚀 JavaScript Journey : Completed an exciting mini-project, Simon Says Game 🎮, with Apna College! Here’s what I learned:

1️⃣ Understanding the game: The player follows the sequence generated by the game. 🧠

2️⃣ Creating the layout: Used HTML & CSS to design 4 divs for game buttons and a heading, giving it a neat structure. 🎨

3️⃣ Starting the game: On any keypress, a random box flashes 💡, and the game begins.

4️⃣ Sequences: Implemented two sequences — one for the user and one for the game. When they match, the level increases, and if not, the game resets. 🔄

5️⃣ Flash effect: Used keypress event listeners and added a "flash" class for the flash effect. Set setTimeout to remove the class after milliseconds for smooth visuals. ⚡

6️⃣ User interaction: The click event triggers the flash effect in green when a user clicks the boxes. 🟩

7️⃣ Game Over: When the game ends, everything resets—user sequence, game sequence, and the level. Back to square one! 🎮🔁
